rollup.coffee — given a line-delimited list of dates from Apache httpd access logs, count how many requests occurred in a given time window.

Each line looks like this:
168.75.67.132 - - [23/Nov/2011:17:29:24 -0500] "POST /fnic-1/pxcentral/notifications/policy.updated HTTP/1.1" 200 69 "-" "ShortBus/1.1 (Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.1.5;Java 1.6.0_20;Windows 2003 5.2)"
        
There are 2 big problems with this right now:
    1) it requires loading the entire set of dates into memory all at once before processing
    2) for every window we scan through the entire set of dates
This uses a ton of memory and CPU time. If we need to process a large data set into a set of small windows,
    it could take a lot of resources and time.

A possibly better approach might be to build the set of windows on the fly, as we go, and process the dates
    one at a time.

So maybe the function would take a seq of rollup data, and a new date, and figure out where it fits.
    It would search for a window in which it fit — if it found one, voila, done.
    If not, it'd create it and add it to the seq.

Essentially, instead of looping through all the dates for each window, loop through all the windows for each date.
    This'd almost certainly save memory, since it could "stream", although it might not be more CPU efficient.


TO DO:
* Support parallellization (off by default)
* Support other event timestamp formats
* Support other output formats (starting with JSON)
* Support cmd-line arg for csv separator
* Add an option to specify whether weeks should start on Sunday or Monday

    ###
    this has the (small) advantage of not requiring the dates to be sorted
        but it's far less efficient when using small windows
        because we have to filter _all_ the dates for each window
